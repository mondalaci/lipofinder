There are thousands of LiPo battery sizes for your project, but choosing the one that fits the best was no easy task until now. Meet the [LiPo battery finder](https://mondalaci.github.io/lipofinder/), which allows you to filter batteries based on x, y, and z sizes.

This tool contains a scraper that extracts the pages and subpages of https://www.pdbattery.com/li-polymer-battery-cells-list.html and https://www.lipolbattery.com, creating a .mjs file as a result.

The .mjs file gets imported by the web application, allowing the scraped records to be searched interactively.
